JavaScript Exercise
Create a file ReviewExercise.js. Use Node.js to run this file.
Complete the instructions and then then test the function.

1. Write a function which accepts an array of numbers and returns the sum of all 
the even numbers in the array. Have the function use the reduce method to calculate 
the sum of the even numbers.

2. Create an array which represents a person’s skills. The first and second elements
are the person’s name. The remaining elements in the array are the person’s skills.
EX// [“Eric”, “Stock”, “Java”, “Game Design”, “Teaching”]
EX// [“Pranjal”, “Patra”, “Python”]
Create a function which accepts an array as an argument and uses the destructure
operator to place the first and last name into variables. Use the rest operator to 
place the skills into a new array. The function should then print the person’s name 
and loop through the skills array and print out each skill.

3. Create an array with the following values [ “hello”, “there”, “how”, “are”, “you”].
Use the destructuing and the rest operator to store the first two values in variables
and to store the remaining 3 values in an array.

4. Create two arrays. The first array will have the numbers 1 up to 6 and the 2nd
array will have the numbers 7 up to 15.
Use the spread operator to create a new array which includes the contents of the
first two arrays. Console.log the new array.

5. Create an array with several numbers. Use the map method to create a new array
where each value is the corresponding value in the original array with 10 subtracted.
Console.log the new array.
