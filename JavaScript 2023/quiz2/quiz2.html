        <h1>Quiz 2</h1>
        <h3>Question 1:</h3>
        <h4>
            You have been given an array of colors (see quiz2.js). In JavaScript, using the forEach array method
            and an anonymous (arrow) function, create and append buttons to the q1area such that each contains
            the text of the colour and has the background of that color.
        </h4>
        <div id="q1area">               
        </div>

        <h3>Question 2:</h3>
        <h4>
            Using JavaScript, and the supplied array of car objects and the color array above, starting 
            with the first vehicle and the first color, update each vehicle at each array position with
            the corresponding color at the same array position. Do not hard code - it should work with
            6 objects or 6 million. Use either a loop or the array's forEach method for your solution.
        </h4>
        <div id="q2area">               
        </div>

        <h3>Question 3:</h3>
        <h4>
            Using JavaScript, create three buttons. The first button has a light blue background, the others are white.
            Button id and button text should be "button0", "button1", and "button2".
            When any of the white buttons are pressed, the current blue button becomes white, and the
            pressed button becomes blue.
            <br><br><em>Bonus</em> (and totally optional): Use Javascript to place a numeric input field before the buttons. Default value is 3. Restrict mininimum
            to 2 and maximum to 8. The count of buttons should match the input value. If the value is changed,
            the number of buttons is adjusted.
        </h4>
        <div id="q3area">               
        </div>
     </body>
